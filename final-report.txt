FINAL REPORT

        boasts innumerable
        characteristics of a
        vibrant metropolis,
        a fair, simple, and
        transparent property
        tax system is not
        among them.

Dear Mayor de Blasio and Speaker Johnson:
On behalf of the members of the New York City Advisory Commission on Property Tax Reform, I am pleased to
transmit this final report on reforming New York City’s property tax system. Real property tax reform is a com-
plex and not easy subject to undertake. Carrying out this reform effort and holding public hearings through the
COVID-19 pandemic added additional unforeseen obstacles.
The Commission was proud to release a preliminary report on January 31, 2020 with 10 initial recommen-
dations that, if enacted, would constitute the most significant reforms to the current property tax system
since its inception 40 years ago. After the Commission released the preliminary report, we were poised
to immediately continue our work. A hearing in Staten Island was scheduled for March 12, 2020, to
solicit feedback on the 10 initial recommendations, hearings in other boroughs were being sched-
uled, and further modeling was underway for the Commission’s consideration. The notion that our work
would be interrupted by a once-in-a-century pandemic was not contemplated in our workplan, so when it
became necessary to cancel the Staten Island hearing and pause our deliberations, our momentum was natu-
rally interrupted.
We are glad that we were able to continue the work we started and deliver this final report that will hopefully
be a resource to you and your successors, other policymakers, the general public, and to all stakeholders who
want to see a fair, equitable and transparent property tax system.
The Commission resumed its work in the Spring of 2021, holding another five public hearings and meeting
regularly to discuss and analyze data and modeling. The Commission’s work in the past several months was
to refine its initial recommendations to meet the mandate you set forth to evaluate the existing property tax
system with the goal of issuing recommendations to make the system “simpler, clearer, and fairer, while ensur-
ing there is no reduction in revenue used to fund essential City services.” We believe this final report accom-
plishes the mandate with which we have been charged.
I want to express my deep gratitude to members of the Commission who voluntarily devoted countless hours
to the effort and participated with vigor, creativity, and intellect. I also want to acknowledge the team of dedi-
cated and talented expert staff who provided detailed information and analysis without which the Commission
could not complete its work.
This project could not have been completed without the staff leadership provided by Sherif Soliman who began
the effort as Senior Advisor to the First Deputy Mayor and completed it as he took on the additional role of
Finance Commissioner for the City of New York. On behalf of the entire Commission and its staff, I thank him
for his service.

Sincerely,




Marc V. Shaw

11         THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
              The Commission has reached consensus on 10 final recommendations:
1. The Commission recommends creating a new expanded residential class, consisting of 1-3 family homes,
     coops, condominiums, and 4-10 unit rental buildings. The property tax system would continue to consist
     of four classes of property: residential; large rentals; utilities; and commercial.
2. The Commission recommends using a sales-based methodology to value all properties in the
     new residential class.
3. The Commission recommends ending fractional assessments for all property types. Each property would be
     assessed at its full market value. This will result in an increase in the taxable base and the tax rate required
     to generate the same level of revenue will decrease.
4. The Commission recommends eliminating current assessed value growth caps for the new residential class
     and instituting five-year transitional treatment for market value growth, whereby year-on-year changes in
     market values are phased-in over five years at 20 percent per year.
5. The Commission recommends creating a partial homestead exemption for primary resident owners in the
     new residential class. This exemption should be either a flat rate or a graduated marginal rate exemption
     for primary resident owners with incomes up to $500,000, with a phase-out of the benefit for owners
     with incomes exceeding $375,000. The Commission recommends retaining all existing personal exemption
     programs and eliminating the current coop-condo abatement, since recommendations 1-4 negate the need
     for an abatement to address inequities between 1-3 family homes and coops and condos.
6. The Commission recommends creating a circuit breaker, based on the ratio of property tax to income, in order
     to reduce the property tax burden on primary resident owners. The circuit breaker should be for primary
     resident owners with a ratio of tax paid to income exceeding 10 percent and incomes below $90,550, with
     the benefit phasing out for incomes exceeding $58,000. The benefit amount should be capped at $10,000.
7. The Commission recommends eliminating the current class share system and replacing it with a system that
     freezes relative tax rates for five-year periods. Under the new system, while the Mayor and the City Council
     can adjust tax rates, the tax rates for all classes may only be altered on a proportional basis within each
     five-year period. There would no longer be changes in tax rates driven by market value shares, as under the
     current system. Every five years the City would conduct a mandated study to analyze whether adjustments
     are needed in order to maintain consistency in the share of taxes relative to the fair market value borne by
     each tax class.
8. The Commission recommends that for properties not in the new residential class (rental buildings with
     more than 10 units, commercial parcels, and utilities), current valuation methods be maintained. There will
     be separate tax classes for rental buildings with more than 10 units, commercial parcels, and utilities. As
     noted in recommendation 3, the Commission recommends removing fractional assessments for all these
     tax classes.
9. The Commission recommends that for the new residential class, phase-in to the new system should occur
     over five years. When a property transfers during the five-year transition period, it will be fully phased into
     the new system the fiscal year after the transfer.
10. The Commission recommends the City institute a mandatory comprehensive review of the property tax
     system every 10 years by the City.

Further details on the Commission’s recommendations can be found in the main body of this final report.

20      THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
III. Data Updates. Fiscal Year 2019 vs. Fiscal Year 2021
The Commission’s preliminary report outlined the current property tax system and described the eight steps the
Department of Finance (DOF) takes to calculate the property tax liability for any given property. The method of
calculation remains unchanged and is therefore not included in this introductory section. However, the latest
available data are now Fiscal Year 2021, so Commission members have used the updated information to for-
mulate recommendations for the final report. A side-by-side comparison of data from the preliminary report
and final report is found below.
It should be noted that the updated data does not alter the evaluations made by the Commission in the
“System Challenges and Issues Addressed in Reform” section of the preliminary report. For example, the Fiscal
Year 2021 data does not change the fundamental conclusion that the current system for valuing coops and
condos based on comparable rentals pursuant to state law is regressive. Higher-valued properties are assessed
at a smaller fraction than lower valued properties. Nonetheless, the updated data with minor adjustments are
included here for readers’ reference.
TA B L E S A N D F I G U R E S
Table 4 shows that DOF values capture a relatively small share of the sales-based market value of coop units. In Fiscal Year
2021, the median coop carries a DOF assessed value of 25 percent of the sales-based market value, which is the same as it
was in Fiscal Year 2019. There is variation by borough, however, as DOF captures the smallest share of sales-based market
value in Brooklyn (0.22) and the largest share in the Bronx (0.30). These ratios were 0.21 and 0.32, respectively, in Fiscal
Year 2019.
As discussed extensively in the preliminary report, even though the IAAO recommends the use of comparable sales to value
coops where sales data are sufficient, Section 581 of the New York State Real Property Tax Law requires that coops and
class 2 condos be valued as if they were rental properties. Therefore, to comply with New York State law, assessors impute
rental income based upon rents received in comparable rental buildings.
There is considerable evidence that this has resulted in the undervaluation of coop properties relative to sales-based market
value, in part because (depending on the age and location of the coop building being valued) comparable buildings may fall
under rent stabilization laws and regulations that constrain rental income.

Table 5 shows that current DOF values capture a decreasing share of a coop unit’s sales-based market value as sales-based
market value increases. One of the key reasons for this is the scarcity of appropriate comparable rental properties for very
high-end properties. The median ratio of DOF value to sales-based market value in Fiscal Year 2021 decreases from 0.57
for coop units with sales-based market values less than $100,000 to 0.11 for units valued greater than $10,000,000. The
corresponding ratios for Fiscal Year 2019 were 0.49 and 0.10, respectively.

Condos also must be valued as if they were rental properties instead of using actual transaction prices. Table 6 below shows
that, as with coop units, DOF value generally captures only a portion of the sales-based market value of condo parcels.
For the median condo in New York City in Fiscal Year 2021, DOF value captures 22 percent of sales-based market value. The
median share ranges from 18 percent in Queens to 34 percent in the Bronx. In Fiscal Year 2019, the lowest shares were
found in Brooklyn and Queens (18 percent) and the highest in the Bronx (34 percent)

Again, like with coop units, DOF values capture a decreasing share of the sales-based market value of a condo unit as sales-
based market value increases, as shown in Table 7.
The median ratio of DOF value to sales-based market value for Fiscal Year 2021 decreases from 0.53 for condo units
with a sales-based market value less than $100,000, to 0.12 for condo units valued at greater than $10,000,000. The
corresponding ratios for Fiscal Year 2019 were 0.34 and 0.10, respectively.

For small rental buildings, defined as having between four and 10 units, DOF uses an income-based approach known as
the gross income multiplier (GIM) which establishes ratios of value to gross income for comparable properties. A GIM is
determined by dividing typical sales prices within a neighborhood by typical annual income from properties that did file a
Real Property Income and Expense (RPIE) statement, and is adjusted for growth rates for these properties. This factor is then
applied to estimated annual income to derive a value.

Table 8 compares DOF values for small rentals with market values generated instead by using the comparable sales
approach for Fiscal Year 2021. Among all small rentals citywide, for the median property, DOF captures half of the sales-
based market value. DOF values cover the lowest share of sales-based value in Brooklyn (47 percent) and the largest in the
Bronx (67 percent). In Fiscal Year 2019, the lowest ratio was found in Manhattan (45 percent) and the highest in the Bronx
(78 percent).

Disparities among the tax liability of class 1 properties is one of the key issues in the current property tax system.
Class 1 properties are subject to AV growth caps, which has meant that similarly valued properties may pay different
property taxes, violating a principal component of fairness.
For example, class 1 properties are not typically taxed at the 6 percent assessment ratio because of statutory AV growth
caps. As a result, two similarly valued class 1 properties could face different ETRs depending on their history of appreciation.
As market appreciation persists over time, the accumulation of growth caps can lead to situations where high-value class 1
properties pay a lower tax (as well as a lower ETR) than more moderately priced properties.

Table 9 shows the resulting distortions among boroughs caused by the caps, for 1-3 family homes 9. Citywide, the median
ratio between Billable AV and DOF Value (AV ratio) for Fiscal Year 2021 is 4.20 percent, well below the target AV ratio of
6 percent. The median AV ratio in Manhattan and Brooklyn, the two boroughs that have seen dramatic property value
appreciation, are 2.22 percent and 3.38 percent, respectively. Staten Island, where appreciation has been comparatively
slower and therefore AVs are less frequently subject to growth caps, has the highest median AV ratio of 4.89 percent.
In Fiscal Year 2019, the median AV ratio was slightly lower in Manhattan (2.10 percent) compared to Fiscal Year 2021, but
higher in the outer boroughs. Staten Island also had the highest AV ratio in Fiscal Year 2019 (5.20 percent).

    AV growth caps also apply to small Class 2 properties (4 to 10 unit rentals buildings and 2 to 10 unit coop and condo buildings), with
    yearly increases limited to 8 percent, or 30 percent cumulatively over five years. The implications of the caps for small Class 2 properties
    are similar to those observed for class 1 properties.

26                                                                                                                 THE ROAD TO REFORM:
Table 10, below, shows how the share of DOF value, sales-based market value, and tax levy varies by property type. The DOF
value is as of the Fiscal Year 2021 assessment roll, and the sales-based market values are current DOF values for class 1 and
estimated values for all other tax classes. The tax levy is net of all exemptions and abatements.
The disconnect between existing DOF values and tax levy shares is illustrated by class 1 representing 48 percent of value but
only 14 percent of taxes in Fiscal Year 2021. However, when using a common valuation method across all property types,
that being sales-based market values, class 1 represents 24 percent of value. Coop and condo buildings’ market value shares
go from 9 percent in DOF value to 22 percent. These buildings currently account for 15 percent of taxes paid.
Any class with a market share greater than its share of the tax levy is receiving a tax preference. However, it is necessary to
measure market values consistently. Once all properties are valued using the sales-based methodology, class 1 properties,
coops, condos, and small rentals show a tax preference, accounting for 51 percent of sales-based value and paying 33
percent of the levy.
Large rentals and Class 4 properties, on the other hand, comprise 45 percent of value and pay 58 percent of the levy. With
the common denominator of sales-based market value, the apparent tax preference for class 1 properties, coops, condos,
and small rentals is less pronounced compared to current legally mandated DOF values.
These figures have remained largely stable since Fiscal Year 2019.

Figure 1 provides a comparison of ETRs by property type in Fiscal Years 2019 and 2021 using sales-based market values for
consistent treatment across property types. The property types with the highest median ETR in Fiscal Year 2021 are offices
($1.72), a slight increase from $1.66 in Fiscal Year 2019. Offices make up a large portion of the square footage in Class 4. After
Offices, the highest Fiscal Year 2021 median ETRs are for large rentals ($1.53) and class 4 non-utility properties ($1.31). Both
large rentals and class 4 non-utility properties had similar ETRs in Fiscal Year 2019.

For the remaining residential property types, the Fiscal Year 2021 median ETRs vary within a relatively small band, ranging
from $0.72 for small rentals to $0.93 for coops. In Fiscal Year 2019, for these property types median ETRs ranged from $0.63
for Class 2 condos to $0.88 for coops.

Other studies 10 of ETRs in New York have painted a somewhat different picture due to the lack of a common denominator,
such as sales-based market values, to calculate ETRs. Previous studies have used DOF values for non-class 1 properties which
are much lower than sales-based market values, as shown in the tables above, resulting in higher and non-representative ETRs.

ETRs vary among the different property types and also within the various property types. As Figure 1 shows, for all property
types there is a considerable gap between 25th percentile and 75th percentile ETRs. Exemption and abatement programs
contribute to differences in ETRs within specific property types. Details of current housing and economic development
programs are shown in the Appendix.
Among 1-3 family homes, variation in ETRs is caused primarily by the differential effects of AV growth caps. Specifically, in
neighborhoods where market values are appreciating rapidly, ETRs will tend to be lower as a result of these growth caps.

As Table 11 shows, the median Fiscal Year 2021 ETR for 1-3 family homes is lowest in Manhattan ($0.45) and highest in
Staten Island ($0.97). Manhattan and Staten Island had the lowest ($0.41) and highest ($1.02) median Fiscal Year 2019
median ETR respectively.
Within boroughs, there is also considerable variation. In Brooklyn, for example, the difference between a taxpayer at the
25th percentile and one at the 75th percentile is $0.45 (the difference was $0.46 in Fiscal Year 2019).

As shown in Table 12, ETRs also vary considerably by property value category. In general, lower-valued homes face a
substantially higher ETR, largely the result of homes in higher-valued and more rapidly appreciating neighborhoods
disproportionately benefiting from AV growth caps. This is true in both Fiscal Years 2019 and 2021.

There is also considerable variation in ETRs among condos, coops, and small rentals, as shown previously in Figure 1. Similar
to 1-3 family homes, smaller condos, coops, and small rental buildings are subject to AV growth caps. In addition, there is
another important factor affecting variation in ETRs for all condos, coops, and rentals regardless of size: the varying degrees
to which DOF value captures sales-based market value.
Specifically, In Fiscal Year 2021 DOF value captures a lower share of sales-based market value for higher-priced coops (Table
5). DOF value captures 57 percent of sales-based market value at the lowest end of the coop price spectrum (less than
$100K), and this percentage declines as price increases, with only 11 percent of sales-based value captured for those at the
highest end (greater than $10M). Table 5 also shows the same pattern for Fiscal Year 2019 data.

As shown in Table 13, this translates to a regressive pattern of ETRs: the lowest-valued coops have a Fiscal Year 2021
median ETR of $1.78, while the highest-valued coops are subject to a median ETR of only $0.45 (in Fiscal Year 2019 these
figures were $1.76 and $0.39, respectively).

The pattern of DOF values capturing a declining portion of sales-based market values is similar for condos (Table 7). DOF
value captures 53 percent of sales-based market value for condos valued at less than $100K in Fiscal Year 2021, and this
percentage generally decreases as sales-based market value increases, reaching only 12 percent for condos with sales-based
values greater than $10M. In Fiscal Year 2019 these shares were 34 percent and 10 percent respectively.

However, as shown in Table 14, condos do not show the same pattern in their median ETRs as coops. In Fiscal Year 2021,
condos valued at less than $100K have a median ETR of $0.57, while condos at the highest end pay $0.50, and there is
significant variation at intervening price levels. This is primarily due to the 421-a tax exemption. In Fiscal Year 2019, these
median ETRs were $0.41 and $0.44, respectively.

37          THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
Analyzing the Impact of Implementing the Structural Changes in the
Commission’s Recommendations
The Commission’s analysis rests on a simulation model that assumes an immediate switch to these recommen-
dations, without any transition period; thus, reported results are after all recommendations are fully phased-in.
In keeping with the Commission’s mandate of revenue neutrality, the aggregate tax for the new residential class
equals the aggregate tax for these properties in Fiscal Year 2021.
The model is intended to highlight the general redistributive impacts of reform and does not attempt to
project the ultimate tax incidence and economic results of a new property tax regime. The model does not
make assumptions about possible real estate market adjustments resulting from reform and does not include
assumptions about future economic conditions.
The simulation model assumes that all current exemption and abatement programs will continue, except for
the coop-condo abatement, which would not be required post-reform.13

A N A LY S I S O F T H E S T R U C T U R A L R E F O R M S
Under the Commission’s structural reform recommendations, the nominal property tax rate required to gener-
ate the same amount of revenue would be 0.814 percent, reflecting the new larger tax base. The ETRs for all
parcels in the new residential class would be identical before exemptions and abatements because all parcels
would be valued at their full sales-based market value.

Table 15 shows ETRs before exemptions and abatements for Fiscal Year 2021 under the current system and after the
Commission’s four structural reform recommendations. As a result of the recommended structural changes to the property
tax system, horizontal equity would be increased as all parcels within the new residential class, irrespective of property type
or value, would be taxed at the same ETR prior to the application of exemptions and abatements. The system would also
be simpler, since a property’s tax calculation starts with its full sales-based market value, and more transparent, making it
easier for taxpayers to understand how their tax bills are calculated. Under the current system, the median ETR varies by
major property type, as does the interquartile range 14. After structural reform recommendations 1-4, all properties in the
new residential class would have the same ETR ($0.81) before exemptions and abatements.
13
   The coop-condo abatement, created in 1996 to offset some of the inequities between class 1 and class 2 properties, is no longer needed
   since the Commission’s recommendations address these inequities.

   The interquartile range is the difference between the 25th percentile value and the 75th percentile value.

To mitigate tax burden on vulnerable populations, policy decisions have been made to provide subsets of parcels with
exemptions and abatements. The inclusion of exemptions and abatements creates variation in ETRs. Figure 2 below
compares current Fiscal Year 2021 ETRs after all current exemptions and abatements to post-reform ETRs after all current
exemptions and abatements15. In Fiscal Year 2021, the median ETRs among the major property types in the new residential
class range from $0.72 for small rentals to $0.93 for coops.
The chart shows that after the implementation of the Commission’s four structural reform recommendations, median ETRs
would be much more uniform across property types, ranging from $0.79 to $0.81.

market value category. In Fiscal Year 2021, for all parcels and for primary resident owners 16, as sales-based market value
increases, median ETR decreases. For properties valued at less than $100,000, the median ETR in Fiscal Year 2021 is
$1.22, whereas the median ETR for properties valued at over $10 million is only $0.52. The Commission made fixing this
regressivity a major focus of its work.

        A parcel is defined as a unit for coops and as a tax lot for all other property types (with tax lot defined as unique combination of
        borough, block and lot identifiers, or a “BBL”).


As Table 16 illustrates, the regressivity that is in the current system would be removed after incorporating the four structural
reform recommendations proposed by the Commission. Median ETRs would be more similar for all properties in the new
residential class irrespective of sales-based market value.

     A parcel is classified within the Commission’s analysis as occupied by a primary resident homeowner, either by a successful match of a Tax
     Year 2018 personal income tax return to FY2019 property ownership information, or receipt of an exemption (such as School Tax Relief,
     or Senior Citizen Homeowners Exemption) or an abatement (such as the Coop-Condo Tax Abatement) in FY2021 which requires primary
     residency.

Table 17 shows the impact of the Commission’s four structural reform recommendations on ETRs by primary resident owner
income 17. Under the current system, in Fiscal Year 2021, median ETRs are lowest for those with the highest incomes (ETRs
between $0.66 and $0.70), but highest for those with incomes between $75,000 and $400,000 (ETRs between $0.84 and
$0.89). About 70 percent of primary resident owners have incomes below $150,000, and most of their parcels have higher
ETRs than the parcels owned by primary residents earning over $1,000,000. Addressing this has been a top priority of this
Commission.

After incorporating the Commission’s four structural reform recommendations, median ETRs would be much more equal
across the various income ranges. Median ETRs would be slightly lower for primary resident owners earning less than
$400,000 (median ETRs between $0.76 and $0.80).
Table 18 shows the impact of the Commission’s four structural reform recommendations on ETRs across the City’s five
boroughs. For all parcels, under the current system in Fiscal Year 2021, the highest median ETR is found in Manhattan
($0.98), followed by Staten Island ($0.96). The lowest median ETR is found in Brooklyn ($0.63).

After implementing the Commission’s four structural reform recommendations, the citywide median ETR would decrease
from $0.84 to $0.80. Among the boroughs, for all parcels, the largest decrease in median ETR would be in Staten Island,
from $0.96 to $0.77. As a result of Brooklyn’s current Fiscal Year 2021 ETR, which is significantly lower than the citywide
ETR, Brooklyn would be the only borough to see an increase in median ETR, from $0.63 to $0.80.
For primary resident owners only, the highest median ETR is found in Staten Island ($0.95) and the lowest in Brooklyn
($0.64). The overall primary resident median ETR would decrease from $0.83 to $0.78.

E VA L U AT I O N
As shown in the tables above, the current property tax system is regressive when ETRs are analyzed by sales-
based market value and by owner income.
The four structural recommendations would enhance horizontal equity, as shown by the equalizing of median
ETRs within and across property types in the new residential class, and across sales-based market values, pri-
mary resident owner incomes, and boroughs.
The recommendations would also make the system much simpler for all taxpayers in the new residential class,
and make it easier for taxpayers to calculate taxes and their ETR. Differences in ETRs would be due only to the
impact of current exemption or abatement programs, which represent intentional deviations from horizontal
equity for specific policy purposes.




42         THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
Providing Targeted Relief for Primary Resident Owners
Fairness in taxation involves more than horizontal equity, the goal of these four structural reform proposals. As a
result, the Commission views its four structural reform recommendations as the first step to a better property tax
system. The second step is the ability-to-pay imperative, which has been a longstanding foundation for providing
property tax exemptions and abatements to vulnerable populations. Targeted property tax relief for vulnerable
populations, e.g., the Senior Citizen Homeowners Exemption and Disabled Homeowner Exemption, have been
widely embraced and are policies that the Commission has determined should stay in the new system.
The Commission concluded that there is a need for additional targeted tax relief for primary residents. Such
targeted programs would make the system fairer by rewarding owners who use their property as their primary
residence and help low- and moderate-income primary resident owners better afford their tax bills.
There are limitless combinations for designing homeowner tax relief programs, and a final decision on the exact
specifications is for policymakers to decide. In this final report, the Commission has attempted to find a balance
between providing meaningful relief to a significant number of primary resident owners and maintaining reve-
nue neutrality within the restructured property tax system.

The Commission recommends two primary resident
owner relief programs:                                     Options for a Partial Homestead Exemption
                                                           Below are the two options for a homestead exemp-

   Washington DC has a graduated tax rate structure for commercial/industrial properties based on sales-based market value (https://otr.cfo.
   dc.gov/page/real-property-tax-rates). However, this structure is not applied to residential properties nor is it marginal.
19
   The $90,550 threshold was chosen as it is the FY21 income limit for enhanced School Tax Relief (STAR). In FY22, the enhanced STAR limit
   is $92,000. Enhanced STAR is for primary resident owners aged 65 and over with income under stated threshold.
45        THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
As noted, several options exist to modify the circuit breaker design including adjusting the tax-to-income
threshold, the benefit percentage, and the income threshold at which owners would qualify. Ultimately, the
circuit breaker with the parameters specified above would meaningfully alleviate the tax burden for eligible
primary resident owners and is, therefore, a key feature of reform that the Commission is advancing.


Analyzing the Impact of a Partial Homestead Exemption and a Circuit Breaker
Most primary resident owners who receive either of the proposed homeowner relief benefits, or both, would
see a reduction in their tax liability compared to their Fiscal Year 2021 tax before reform and compared to
reform with structural changes only (no owner relief). The following series of tables illustrate the impact of
these owner relief programs on ETRs by sales-based market value, by primary resident owner income and by
borough. Non-resident parcels would have a slightly higher liability and ETR compared to reform with structural
changes only.
Table 22 shows ETRs by sales-based market value after incorporating either of the partial homestead exemption options and
the circuit breaker.

46        THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
Under the current system ETRs are highest for the lowest-valued properties and decline as sales-based market value increases.
In Fiscal Year 2021, under the current system, the median ETR for primary resident owner parcels valued at less than $100,000
is $1.47, while parcels over $10 million have a median ETR of $0.46. Under a model with a 20 percent flat rate exemption,
those ETRs are $0.43 and $0.94, respectively. Under a model with a 30 percent graduated marginal rate exemption, the ETRs
are $0.35 and $0.96, respectively.
Under either partial homestead exemption option, as sales-based market values increases, so would the median ETR. Only for
primary resident owner parcels with a sales-based market value above $2.5 million would the median ETR be higher under a
reformed system than under the current system.
Under a system with the graduated marginal rate exemption, the median ETRs would be lower for primary resident owner
parcels with a sales-based market value of up to $2.5 million compared to a system with the flat rate exemption. This is
because the graduated marginal rate exemption has a higher benefit percentage for the first $500,000 of a parcel’s sales-
based market value. Conversely, median ETRs for parcels valued at over $2.5 million would be slightly higher (between $0.02-
$0.03) under a system with a graduated marginal rate exemption compared to a flat rate exemption.
Table 23 shows ETRs by primary resident owner income after incorporating either of the partial homestead exemption options
and the circuit breaker.

        A parcel is defined as a unit for coops and as a tax lot for all other property types (with tax lot defined as unique combination
        of borough, block and lot identifiers, or a “BBL”)..

Under the current system, in Fiscal Year 2021, the highest median ETRs were seen for those with incomes between $75,000
and $400,000. With both the homestead exemption and the circuit breaker programs, those with the lowest incomes would
have the lowest median ETRs, and as primary resident owner income increases, so would the median ETR.
For primary resident owners with income less than $400,000, the median ETR would decrease after implementing the
Commission’s recommendations. The median decreases by income categories range from $0.10 to $0.53 depending on
primary resident owner income and partial homestead exemption option.

47        THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
Under both homestead exemption models, more than half of all primary resident owners with incomes above $500,000
would pay the same ETR ($0.94 under the flat rate exemption and $0.96 under the graduated marginal rate exemption).
The Commission’s recommendations would increase vertical equity, resulting in a fairer system that retains the principle of
the ability to pay by helping ensure taxpayers can afford their property tax bills.
Table 24 shows the impact of incorporating either of the partial homestead exemption options and the circuit breaker into
the models on ETRs by borough.
Overall, citywide, the Fiscal Year 2021 median ETR under the current system is $0.84 for all parcels and $0.83 for primary
resident owners only. If only the four structural reform recommendations were included, these median ETRs would decrease
to $0.80 and $0.78, respectively.
However, as shown in Table 24, the citywide median ETR decreases further when the owner relief programs are included.
The 20 percent flat rate exemption would result in a citywide median ETR for primary resident owners of $0.71. The 30
percent graduated marginal rate exemption would decrease the citywide median ETR for primary resident owners to $0.65.

Additionally, after including either of the homestead
exemption options and the circuit breaker, the 75th
percentile ETR in Brooklyn would decrease for pri-
mary resident owners. Currently, the 75th percentile
ETR is $0.84, which would decrease to $0.75 under
a system with a 20 percent flat rate exemption and
to $0.71 under a system with a 30 percent graduated
rate exemption.
By including primary resident owner relief in the pro-
posed new system, the Commission’s recommenda-
tions are not only rewarding primary resident own-
ership by reducing the tax burden for these owners,
they are also adhering to the ability-to-pay principle
that the Commission deems vital.

The State Legislature has lowered the 5 percent class share cap 24 times between Fiscal Year 1993 and Fiscal Year 2021,
further limiting levy increases on residential properties. Table 25 shows the resulting cumulative reduction in class 1’s levy of
more than $4.4 billion.

     Note that each tax class’s taxable billable assessed value may grow at a different rate than its market value (which determines levy
     share), as taxable billable assessed value depends on assessment increase caps or transitional phase-ins, as well as on exemptions.

53        THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
Comparison with Other Jurisdictions
The annual Lincoln Land Institute of Land Policy and Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence report on property
tax burden compares ETRs of homestead, apartment, and commercial properties in New York as well as across
52 other cities 23. Table 26 below shows the results of their 2020 study (columns 1, 2, 4, 5) as well as from the
Commission’s own analysis of ETRs of every City parcel (columns 3, 6). Lower ranks indicate higher ETRs.
The figures presented below differ somewhat from previous studies of New York City’s ETRs, which did not use
sales-based market values for all parcels. Studies relying on DOF values 24, rather than using sales-based market
values for all parcels, considerably overstate the disparity in ETRs between class 1 and the other tax classes.
When ETRs are computed using sales-based market values for all parcels, as done by the Commission, those
differences shrink dramatically.

The ETRs for New York City apartments and commercial ranked 34th and 35th, respectively, out of the 53 cities studied
(column 2), indicating relatively low ETRs. The ETRs (also column 2) were $1.29 and $1.43, respectively. The ETRs from the
Commission’s analysis were $1.53 and $1.38, respectively. ETRs for commercial and apartment properties are below the
average of the 53 cities (columns 1 and 2).

New York City ranks highly when considering the ratio of ETRs of apartment and commercial to homestead, 2nd and 6th,
respectively. The ratios (shown in column 5) were 2.55 and 3.23 respectively, which compares to 1.86 and 1.67 based on the

55      THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
Based on above, the tax bill for a parcel in any given year of the transition will be calculated as follows:
Final tax bill = prior year’s tax bill
   + annual phase-in due to reform
   + phase-in due to annual market value changes
In Example 7 shown below, the parcel’s tax bill in the year before reform is enacted was $3,500. After reform, the parcel’s
tax liability would increase to $5,000. Therefore, in order to account for the impact of reform, the parcel’s annual phase-in
due to reform equals ($5,000-$3,500) / 5 = $300.
The example parcel is assumed to have consistently seen market value growth of 4 percent per year for the years prior to
reform as well as during the transition period. Therefore, in Year 1 the parcel’s tax bill based on its sales-based market value
would be $5,200. The difference between this liability and the corresponding bill of the prior year ($5,000) is the parcel’s
phase-in due to annual market value changes, and equals $5,200-$5,000 = $200.
Therefore, in Year 1, the parcel’s tax bill equals:
 Final tax bill =                                                         $4,000 =
 prior year’s tax bill                                                    $3,500
   + annual phase-in due to reform                                         +$300
   + phase-in due to annual market value changes                           +$200

For each year until the end of the transition, the parcel’s tax bill would incorporate the annual phase-in due to reform and
the phase-in due to annual market value changes. By the last year of the transition period, the parcel’s tax bill would equal
its tax bill under the Commission’s recommendations, with all market value changes that occurred during the transition
period reflected. After five years, the example shows the parcel fully phased into the new system, with its final tax bill
equals $6,083.




56       THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
The transition period would work similarly for parcels whose tax liability would be reduced under reform. In the example
below, which also assumes 4 percent annual market value growth, the parcel’s tax bill in the year before reform was
$5,000. Under the Commission’s recommended changes, the tax liability would decrease to $3,500. The parcel’s annual
phase-in due to reform equals ($3,500-$5,000) / 5 = -$300. After five years and accounting for market value growth in the
intervening period, the example shows the parcel fully phased into the new system, with its final tax bill equal to $4,258.

In each year of the transition, the example parcel would see a year-on-year decrease in its tax bill. Due to the
Commission’s revenue neutrality mandate, any tax increases or decreases seen by parcels as a result of the Commission’s
recommendations need to be transitioned in gradually. Additionally, as described in the preliminary report, the Commission
recommends that if a property is transferred during the transition period, its tax will be set to equal its tax under the new
system. Thus, upon sale, the property would be fully transitioned into the new system. Currently, New York City is one of only
a handful of major jurisdictions that does not have an assessed value reset upon a sale of a property 25.

57          THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
The below example shows what would happen if the parcel illustrated in Example 7 had in fact transferred during the
transition period. Here, the parcel transfers in year two of the transition period, meaning in year three, the parcel’s tax will
be based on its billable market value ($5,624) and the parcel will be fully transitioned into the new system.
The parcel’s tax bill for year three will include all the remaining tax liability phase-in due to reform, in this case $300 for
each year of the three remaining transition years ($900), along with the annual phase-in due to market value changes
between year 2 and year 3 ($216).
A parcel that would see a tax decrease under reform would also transition directly to the lower bill in the year following a
transfer.

59          THE ROAD TO REFORM: A Blueprint for Modernizing and Simplifying New York City’s Property Tax System
The Commission anticipates, for example, particu-
lar needs in the area of tax appeals. Currently, very
few class 1 owners appeal their values. In Fiscal Year
2020, there were only 1,814 class 1 appeals to the Tax
Commission27. Class 1 owners may only appeal their
parcels’ value if “effective market value” is below the
sales-based market value 28.
However, after reform, class 1 parcels would be taxed
directly on their market value, and many more owners
will be eligible to appeal their valuation. Further,
with improved transparency under reform, such
owners will see the direct link between their market
value and their taxes. So, it should be expected that
there will be a large increase in the number of appeals
filed, and the City will need a customer-friendly
system to handle these appeals in an efficient and
equitable manner.

     The effective market value is defined as assessed value divided by .06, the target assessment ratio. Most class 1 parcels are well below
     the target 6 percent assessment ratio, due to the current assessed value caps. Owners of such properties cannot benefit from an appeal
     until the assessed values of the properties reach the target assessment ratio. Under current treatment, even when a property experiences
     a market value decrease, a property’s assessed value will continue to rise, subject to the annual or five-year caps, until it reaches the
     target assessment ratio.
